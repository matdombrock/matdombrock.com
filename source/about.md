# About Me and This Site

My name is Mathieu Dombrock and I'm a software engineer by day and electronics hacker by night!


This site is built using my own custom static site generator called [SteelSky](https://github.com/matdombrock/SteelSky)

If anything I'm working on or writing about here interests you feel free to contact me.
