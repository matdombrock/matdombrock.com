# Problem Solving

> You nailed it in the first sentence - businesses don't need developers, they really need problem solvers - but we often don't get a seat at that table to turn around a problem before it lands on our desk as a request to code some poorly understood idea someone had.

> 1) Identify the problem - it invariably isn't to do with code but a combination of time and cost.  
> 2) Can the problem be solved without a line of code, such as changing the process and removing the issue that way?   
> 3) Is there an off-the-shelf application, software or component that will solve the problem.  
> 4) Maybe you do need to code something.  

> We are also all too quick to just dive straight in at (4) because that's what we identify as, that's what we enjoy and unfortunately what we get paid to do rather than getting paid to think, advise and value-add.
